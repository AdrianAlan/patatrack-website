### {{page.title}}

We, the Rebel Alliance, do therefore in the name—and by the authority—of the free beings of the Galaxy, solemnly publish and declare our intentions:
* To fight and oppose you and your forces, by any and all means at our disposal;
* To refuse any Imperial law contrary to the rights of free beings;
* To bring about your destruction and the destruction of the Galactic Empire;
* To make forever free all beings in the galaxy.
To these ends, we pledge our property, our honor, and our lives.
