### Future heterogeneous computing farms with HPX
  In High-Energy Physics, experiments' trigger and reconstruction run on homogeneous computing systems. Machines which are not specialized can run different work-flows with average performance. However, the LHC will enter an era of long luminosity doubling times with the expectation that small signals will gradually emerge from backgrounds. Any physics that is discovered will need very high statistics to fully explore its properties, hence requiring large samples of data. The experiments' computing infrastructure has grown, but because of the non-unlimited funding, will not by as much as needed to keep up.
  Making computing systems like the trigger farms heterogeneous would help in optimizing resources, by offloading different types of computation to the machines whose topology and architecture are the best match for the job.
  HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.
  The purpose of this project is to develop a small scale demonstrator with a software framework, based on HPX, that can be used to offload specific type of computation to another better suited node.
